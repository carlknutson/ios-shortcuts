TimeLens is an iOS Shortcut that automatically changes your device's background to a photo from your library taken on the same day 1, 2, 5, or 10 years ago.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Create a new wallpaper:**
   - Before using TimeLens, you need to create a new wallpaper on your device. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this on Apple's official support page: [Change the wallpaper on your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-the-wallpaper-iph3d267104/ios).
   - You can use any photo wallpaper - the underlying image will be updated with the iOS shortcut.
2. **iOS Shortcuts App:**
   - Pre-installed on most iOS devices.

### General Setup

1. **Download the [TimeLens](#download-link) iOS shortcut.**
2. **Configure the Shortcut**
   - After downloading, you will be asked a question to choose which wallpaper will recieve the updates. Choose the new wallpaper that you created in the prerequisite.
2. **Grant Photo Library Access:**
   - The first time you run the shortcut, it will ask for permission to "Allow TimeLens" to set a wallpaper?", click `Allow`.
3. **Set Up Automations:**
   - Use the Shortcuts app to create an automation to run the TimeLens shortcut automatically at a specific time each day. This way, your background will change daily if you had pictures taken from 1, 2, 5, or 10 years ago.



## How It Works

The shortcut performs the following steps:

1. **Get Current Date:** Retrieves the current date.
2. **Find Photos:** Searches your photo library for photos taken on the same day and month as the current date, but from 1, 2, 5, and 10 years ago.
3. **Select a Photo:** If multiple photos are found, one is selected at random.
4. **Set Wallpaper:** The selected photo is set as your device's wallpaper.
