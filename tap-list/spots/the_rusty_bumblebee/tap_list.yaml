It was then finished in cognac barrels, adding elegant notes of dried fruit and contributing to a rich, full mouthfeel.Following the aging process, the stout was blended with Montmorency cherries, citrus, and panela–resulting in a velvety, decadent beer with flavors of candied dark cherry, soft vanilla and a caramelized citrus finish. 14.5% ABV.'

Layered with a blend of cocoa nibs, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, and dates, this full-bodied stout showcases the classic flavors of a chocolate praline while embracing the subtle nuances imparted by the bourbon barrel. 14.6% ABV.'

The result is a malty flavor that is rich bread-y toast with caramel notes and strong maple character.  The German Noble hops lend a subtle balancing spice to the beer but play 2’nd fiddle to the malt/maple profile.
