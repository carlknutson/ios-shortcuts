First aged in freshly emptied bourbon barrels, this stout draws inspiration from the underlying decadence of chocolate, caramel, and roasted nuts found in Original. Layered with a blend of cocoa nibs, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, and dates, this full-bodied stout showcases the classic flavors of a chocolate praline while embracing the subtle nuances imparted by the bourbon barrel. 14.6% ABV.'
