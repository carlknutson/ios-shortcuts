Inspired by the flambéed dessert classic Cherries Jubilee, 2025 Bourbon County Brand Cherries Jubilee Stout captures the essence of cognac-soaked cherries and caramelized citrus.The beer began its aging journey in freshly emptied bourbon barrels, which impart rich layers of oak, warm vanilla and subtle baking spice. It was then finished in cognac barrels, adding elegant notes of dried fruit and contributing to a rich, full mouthfeel.Following the aging process, the stout was blended with Montmorency cherries, citrus, and panela–resulting in a velvety, decadent beer with flavors of candied dark cherry, soft vanilla and a caramelized citrus finish. 14.5% ABV.'

First aged in freshly emptied bourbon barrels, this stout draws inspiration from the underlying decadence of chocolate, caramel, and roasted nuts found in Original. Layered with a blend of cocoa nibs, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, and dates, this full-bodied stout showcases the classic flavors of a chocolate praline while embracing the subtle nuances imparted by the bourbon barrel. 14.6% ABV.'
