Fall festivals including Oktoberfest proved to be a great time to enjoy these well aged and complex beers which were also crisp and refreshing.Maple Märzen brings traditional German malts and hops and blends them with local maple syrup.  The result is a malty flavor that is rich bread-y toast with caramel notes and strong maple character.  The German Noble hops lend a subtle balancing spice to the beer but play 2’nd fiddle to the malt/maple profile.  German lager yeast helps the Märzen stay crisp and clean tasting, letting the other ingredients shine through. This traditional lager style with an added northwoods twist makes a welcome addition to a sunny but cool autumn day or any campfire.'
